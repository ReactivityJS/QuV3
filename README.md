# Qu V3 / Quniverse

A clean, structured rebuild of the layered architecture designed in
`ReactivityJS/Qu` (whitepaper) and implemented in `ReactivityJS/QuV2`: a small,
storage-agnostic core (`QuBit { path, val, ts, pub, sig }`) with Runtime,
Engines, Services, Sync and an application layer built on top of it as
replaceable, independently testable packages.

Read these first, in order:

1. [`docs/v3-architecture-spec.md`](./docs/v3-architecture-spec.md) — critical
   review of the original V3/Quniverse concept (Drupal CMS / ProcessWire CMS /
   GunDB inspired) against QuV2's actual, verified behavior. What to keep,
   what to challenge, what to defer.
2. [`docs/v3-technical-concept.md`](./docs/v3-technical-concept.md) — the
   resulting technical design: Core/Runtime/Engines/Services layer by layer,
   every identified weakness paired with a concrete solution, a storage-query
   API refinement (the `getChildren()` adapter contract), a cross-package
   dependency audit, and a positioning against GunDB/Drupal/ProcessWire.

## Status

Under active, incremental construction — one package at a time, each with its
own tests, built bottom-up per the dependency order in
`docs/v3-technical-concept.md` §11.

- [x] `@qu/core` — QuBit, QuCrypto, QuEvents, QuMount, QuStore, adapters
      (`VolatileAdapter`, `MemoryStoreAdapter`)
- [x] `@qu/foundation` — Registry (Engine/Service lookup), HookBus,
      DependencyResolver, manifest schema, Actions/Slots (`mount` renamed to
      `slot` throughout — see `actions.js`, it collided with `QuMount`/DOM
      `mount()`). `registerCapability`/`capabilities` deliberately **not**
      ported yet — dead API in QuV2, comes back paired with its first real
      caller (see `registry.js`'s doc comment).
- [x] `@qu/runtime` — `FsAdapter` (Node) and `IndexedDBAdapter` (browser),
      each implementing the full `QuAdapter` contract including
      `getChildren()`. Deliberately no shared `.` entry point — only
      `@qu/runtime/fs` and `@qu/runtime/indexeddb` — so a bundle for one
      platform can never accidentally pull in the other's code. The
      `(ts,rel)` sort/cursor logic itself lives once, in `@qu/core`'s new
      `adapters/cursor.js`, reused by `MemoryStoreAdapter` and both of
      these — not reimplemented three times. A conformance test suite runs
      the identical scenarios against all three adapters and asserts they
      agree.
- [x] `@qu/engines` — Document/Collection/Thread/Asset/Access engines.
      `AccessEngine`'s pure decision logic is exported as
      `assertWriteAuthorized()` (throws, doesn't return a boolean — see
      `access-engine.js`'s doc comment) so `@qu/sync` can apply the
      *identical* check to synced writes later — V3's fix for the
      confirmed ACL-bypass-on-sync gap. `ThreadEngine` no longer carries
      its own writer check at all (that was QuV2's migration-era
      "redundant safety net" for pre-uniform-convention data — doesn't
      apply to a fresh build); it now only stamps `_id`/`createdAt`, same
      shape as `DocumentEngine`. A conformance-style end-to-end smoke test
      wires all five engines together on one `QuStore`.
- [x] `@qu/services` (first slice) — `paths`, `unwrap`, `sync-freshness`,
      and **`ListService`**, docs/v3-technical-concept.md §4.2's centerpiece
      redesign: ONE list primitive with two strategies (`listDerived()` —
      no index document, just `QuStore.getChildren()`, for items already
      colocated under a shared parent; `listCurated()`/`addCurated()`/
      `removeCurated()` — a hardened, lock+retry `{$list}` index, replacing
      QuV2's `CollectionService` *and* `StarredService`'s independently
      weaker copy of the same read-modify-write pattern). Regression tests
      reproduce both adversarial races the design doc cites (10 concurrent
      same-process adds; two independent `ListService` instances racing on
      one list) and a synthetic "permanently loses the race" case proving
      the retry gives up gracefully instead of hanging. Deliberately no
      `@qu/core`/`@qu/engines` runtime dependency yet — this slice's source
      only touches the `QuStore` interface it's handed, both are
      devDependencies for tests only. **Deferred to the next round**:
      `StarredService`/`FlagService` (need `@qu/identity` for "my own
      signing key", not yet built) and the `ThreadService` decomposition
      (§4.3) built on top of `ListService`.
- [x] `@qu/identity` — one BIP-39 seed (`@scure/bip39`, audited, not
      hand-rolled), SLIP-10 (Ed25519) derivation for a "main" identity plus
      any number of deterministic, unlinkable per-space pseudonymous
      identities, and attestations that privately prove a space identity
      belongs to a main one (individually encrypted per trusted contact,
      envelope-encrypted once regardless of recipient count). Ported
      essentially unchanged — already bug-free (bounded key/attestation
      caches, `importMnemonic()` already validates the mnemonic before
      deriving) — with one clarity rename: QuV2's `bip32.js` (its own doc
      comment already said "SLIP-10", the filename didn't) is now
      `slip10.js`. No incognito-alias vault — per
      docs/v3-technical-concept.md §1.5, deterministic per-space keys
      already give unlinkable identity at zero sync/storage cost, so V3
      doesn't carry the added complexity of a stored, synced secondary-key
      table. A capstone smoke test signs a thread message with a *real*,
      seed-derived space identity (not a hand-rolled test keypair) and
      confirms `AccessEngine` still gates it correctly, and that a
      *different* space identity derived from the same seed cannot post as
      it. One test-design bug (three identities sharing one `QuStore` — the
      engine's own one-seed-per-store guard correctly rejected it) was
      caught and fixed by moving to one store per identity, with explicit
      QuBit copies standing in for what `@qu/sync` will do for real.
- [x] `@qu/services` (second slice) — `private-storage` (self-encryption
      helpers), `StarredService`, `FlagService`, and its
      `FavoritesService`/`ContactsService` facades. **`StarredService` and
      `FlagService` are not redundant** — `StarredService` is the generic
      "private list I own" primitive (also used directly by non-flag
      features), `FlagService` is the Drupal-Flag-style domain API with two
      modes: *private* (delegates to `StarredService`) and *public* (a
      visible counter — one signed slot per actor, enumerated via
      `ListService.listDerived()`, a completely different mechanism
      `StarredService` can't provide since self-encrypted data is
      inherently private-only). `StarredService` deliberately does NOT
      route through `ListService.addCurated()` — that mode stores
      *references* to items living elsewhere; a starred entry has no
      separate item to reference, so `StarredService` got its own
      lock+retry mutation (same proven pattern, adapted to an inline
      object-array instead of a path-array) rather than being forced
      through the wrong shape. This closes a real gap: QuV2's
      `StarredService` had **no** race mitigation at all. No legacy
      namespace mapping either (same "nothing to migrate in a fresh build"
      reasoning as `ThreadEngine`). One refinement surfaced while building
      `FlagService.getPublicFlags()`: `ListService.listDerived()`'s
      `limit` no longer defaults to 50 — a like-counter silently capped at
      50 would just be wrong, so that default now belongs to whichever
      caller actually wants pagination, not to the generic primitive.
      `ThreadService`'s decomposition (§4.3) is still pending.
