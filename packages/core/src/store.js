/**
 * QU STORE — the storage kernel. This is the class that makes QuStore "dumb"
 * on purpose: it knows how to route a path to a mount, how to build and seal
 * a QuBit, and how to let registered Engines participate in that process. It
 * does NOT know what a "document", "thread" or "collection" is.
 *
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * Why this is not an onion-style middleware pipeline (`(ctx, next) => ...`)
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 * A generic Koa/Express-style middleware chain for both `put` and `get`,
 * where every registered handler ran on every single call and decided for
 * itself (via `path.includes(...)`) whether it was responsible, was tried in
 * an earlier prototype and deliberately reverted (see
 * docs/v3-technical-concept.md §1.3). Two problems with that:
 *
 *   1. Correctness got tangled with performance: the *only* reason the chain
 *      needed onion/`next()` semantics was so the "seal" step (sign +
 *      encrypt) could run strictly after every Engine's transformation, and
 *      so an Engine like AssetEngine could occasionally skip sealing
 *      entirely (it persists chunks itself). That's a two-phase process
 *      ("let engines transform the value, then seal it"), not something
 *      that actually needs recursive continuation-passing.
 *   2. Every `put`/`get` scanned *every* registered Engine and ran a string
 *      match against the path, even for Engines that could never apply.
 *      That's O(total engines) per call, forever, regardless of how many of
 *      them are actually relevant.
 *
 * This version uses a linear, three-step sequence instead:
 *
 *   put(path, val):
 *     1. TRANSFORM  - run only the Engines whose registered `segment`
 *                      appears in `path` (indexed lookup, not a scan), each
 *                      of which may rewrite `val` or declare "I handled
 *                      storage myself, here is the final result".
 *     2. SEAL        - build the QuBit, sign it, and (optionally) encrypt it.
 *                      This step is fixed and cannot be skipped by an Engine
 *                      transform, only bypassed entirely by a `handled` result.
 *     3. PERSIST      - hand the sealed QuBit to the mounted adapter.
 *     4. NOTIFY (async, fault-isolated) - fire a `storage:put` event on the
 *                      internal QuEvents bus for anything that wants to react
 *                      (sync, reactive UI, caches, ...). This is plain
 *                      fan-out, not a value transform, and a broken listener
 *                      can never fail the write that triggered it.
 *
 *   get(path):
 *     1. FETCH        - ask the mounted adapter for the raw QuBit/value.
 *     2. TRANSFORM     - run only the matching Engines, each of which may
 *                      rewrite the result (e.g. a Collection engine resolving
 *                      `$ref`/`$list` pointers).
 *
 * The Engine *indexing* (see `#index`) is what makes step 1 cheap as the
 * number of registered Engines grows: instead of testing every Engine
 * against every path, each Engine declares the one path *segment* it cares
 * about (e.g. "docs", "files") at registration time. Dispatch splits the
 * path into segments once and does O(1) Map lookups per segment, collecting
 * only the Engines that could possibly match - real candidates, not a full
 * scan. Engines that care about every path register with `segment: null` and
 * live in a small "global" bucket that always runs, explicitly opted into
 * rather than re-derived from a wildcard string match.
