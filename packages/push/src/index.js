/**
 * @QU/PUSH — public entry point. See vapid.js/encrypt.js/send.js for the
 * three pieces (auth, payload encryption, transport) and this package's
 * own package.json description for why they're hand-rolled rather than a
 * dependency.
 *
 * HONESTY NOTE, stated as plainly as the rest of this codebase states every
 * known limitation: `encryptPayload()`/`signVapidJwt()` are implemented
 * strictly from the RFC 8291/8188/8292 text and round-trip-tested against
 * THIS package's own `decryptPayload()` (see test/encrypt.test.js) - that
 * proves the ECDH/HKDF/AES-GCM chain is internally self-consistent, but it
 * has NOT been verified end-to-end against a real push service (FCM,
 * Mozilla's push service, ...) with a genuine browser subscription. Before
 * relying on this in production, do one real subscribe-and-push test from
 * an actual deployment.
