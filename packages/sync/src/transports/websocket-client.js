/**
 * WEBSOCKET CLIENT TRANSPORT — connects to a single remote peer (typically a
 * relay) over WebSocket. Works in browsers (native `WebSocket`) and in
 * Node.js 22+ (which ships a global `WebSocket` too); for older Node
 * versions, pass a `WebSocketImpl` (e.g. the `ws` package's export).
 *
 * `send()`/`sendTo()` QUEUE outgoing messages if the socket isn't OPEN yet
 * (not connected, or still mid-handshake) instead of throwing - a raw
 * `WebSocket.send()` throws `InvalidStateError` when called before the
 * 'open' event, and a caller very often has a real reason to start sending
 * before `connect()`'s Promise has resolved: a SyncEngine constructed with
 * this transport (see `sync-engine.js`'s `publishAllTo` option) starts
 * observing local writes immediately, and the FIRST write of a session can
 * legitimately happen before the handshake finishes (e.g. a brand-new
 * identity publishing its own public profile the moment it's created).
 * Queueing means a caller never has to choose between "block everything on
 * the network round-trip" and "risk a crash/dropped write" - connect() can
 * run fully in the background.
 *
 * AUTO-RECONNECT: an unexpected disconnect (network blip, the relay
 * restarting, ...) triggers automatic reconnection with exponential
 * backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, ... capped at `maxReconnectDelayMs`, each with up to
 * 50% jitter so many clients reconnecting to the same relay at once don't
 * all retry in lockstep). `close()` (a DELIBERATE disconnect) disables this -
 * it would be actively wrong for a caller that explicitly asked to
 * disconnect to find itself reconnected a moment later.
 *
 * A fresh reconnection is a BRAND NEW WebSocket connection, which a relay's
 * server-side transport assigns a brand new peerId to - from the relay's
 * SyncEngine's point of view, this is a peer it has never seen
 * subscriptions from before, even though it's "the same" client as far as
 * the app is concerned. `onReconnect()` is the hook that lets SyncEngine
 * (see its constructor) notice this and RE-SEND its active subscriptions
 * over the new connection - without it, a reconnected client would sit
 * there with a healthy-looking socket that silently never receives another
 * live update for anything it had subscribed to before the drop.
