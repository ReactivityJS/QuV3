/**
 * SUBPAGE — the shared "navigate to a real hash route instead of opening a
 * modal" building block. A route like `#/<app>/<...segments>` is a REAL
 * browser history entry - a shell's own header can have working
 * back/forward buttons over that, and the OS/browser back gesture just
 * works too. A `<dialog>` overlay gets none of that for free: closing it
 * isn't a history event, so "how did I get here" and "back" both have to
 * be hand-rolled per app that uses one.
 *
 * This is intentionally tiny: an app still owns its own route parsing
 * (which segment means "create" vs "detail" is app-specific) and its own
 * form fields - this only standardizes the "← back to X" link + content
 * area shell around whatever the app renders, so every subpage in the
 * whole shell looks and behaves the same way.
 *
 * @param {HTMLElement} container - Cleared and (re)populated in place.
 * @param {{backHref: string, backLabel: string, render: (content: HTMLElement) => void}} options
 *   `backHref`/`backLabel` build the back link (a plain `<a>` - not
 *   `history.back()`, so it works identically whether this subpage was
 *   reached by a link, a direct URL, or the browser's own back/forward).
 *   `render(content)` builds whatever the app needs into a fresh, empty
 *   content element already appended below the back link.
