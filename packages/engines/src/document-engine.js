/**
 * DOCUMENT ENGINE — the "docs" convention.
 *
 * Registers against the `docs` path segment only (see QuStore's Engine
 * index in @qu/core/store.js) - it never runs for paths that don't contain
 * a "docs" segment.
 *
 * Behaviour: every document gets a stable `_id` (a real UUID, not
 * `Date.now().toString(36)` - a scheme that collides for any two documents
 * created within the same millisecond, which is common under concurrent
 * writes) and a `_created` timestamp on first write, without overwriting
 * either if the caller already supplied them (so updates don't reset
 * creation metadata).
 *
 * This Engine does NOT expose createDoc/getDoc-style convenience methods -
 * that's @qu/services' DocumentService's job (the Entity API apps actually
 * call). This class only owns the pipeline behaviour.
