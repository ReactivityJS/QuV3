/**
 * DEPENDENCY RESOLVER — turns a package's `requires` list into a safe load
 * order, and turns "we forgot to load something" into one clear error
 * instead of a runtime `Registry: no service named "..."` deep inside some
 * unrelated App.
 *
 * Scope, on purpose:
 *   - Resolves by NAME PRESENCE, not semver ranges. Two Engines named
 *     "document-engine" can't coexist in one Registry anyway (Registry
 *     rejects duplicate names), so "is it registered" is already a
 *     meaningful check. Real semver range resolution (multiple versions
 *     side-by-side, version conflict resolution) is a much bigger feature
 *     with real trade-offs (which version wins? do Engines need to be
 *     version-isolated?) - adding it before there is a second version of
 *     any Engine in the wild would be speculative complexity. This resolver
 *     is intentionally the smallest thing that makes remote/third-party
 *     loading safe today; it can grow into real version resolution later
 *     without changing its public shape.
 *   - Detects circular `requires` and reports the exact cycle.
 *   - Treats anything already present in the Registry as satisfied without
 *     re-loading it - built-in Engines registered by a relay at boot don't
 *     need their own manifest to be "required" by an App.
