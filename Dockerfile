# Multi-stage build. The builder stage installs ALL dependencies (including
# esbuild, a devDependency only needed here) and produces the dist/ bundles
# every client-bearing app needs (see scripts/build-apps.mjs) - `npm run
# relay` serves those bytes as-is (see packages/relay/src/static-apps.js),
# it doesn't build them, and dist/ is deliberately gitignored (build
# output, not source, so it's never in the build context either way). The
# runtime stage then only carries production dependencies (`npm prune
# --omit=dev` once the build step is done - esbuild's job is finished by
# then) plus the built output, on a fresh base image.

# deployment never needs to bake or bind-mount a relay.config.json just to
# set a port or data directory (see docker-compose.yml). No QU_SERVE_SHELL

# "Running Quniverse" section for what that means for testing today.
