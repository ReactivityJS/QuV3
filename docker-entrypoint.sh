# Runs as root at container start (see Dockerfile - no static `USER` there,
# this script drops privileges itself instead). Needed because a Docker
# named/bind-mounted volume is root-owned by default, and Docker only ever
# initializes a volume's ownership FROM the image on that volume's first
# creation - never on later starts, and never for a volume that already
# exists (e.g. one created before this fix existed). A static
# `USER quniverse` in the Dockerfile can't fix that: chown has to run at
# container START, against whatever the volume's ACTUAL current state is,
# every time - cheap (it's metadata, not a data copy) and idempotent.
